    <h2>Banded Archerfish</h2>

      <figcaption>https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/banded-archer-fish</figcaption>
    <p>The Banded Archerfish is unique from other fish in the fact it shoots projectiles, hence its name.</p>
    <p>Through eons of evolutionary changed, the archerfish have adapted to spew jet waves at a distance, usually
    150cm (or 59 inches), but much larger fish can spit as far as 2-3 meters (6-9 feet). This is their prefered method
    of catching and eating prey</p>
    <p>They can even teach each other shoot down moving targets! With an accuracy of 50%. This may not sound accurate,
      but remember, a baseball player only needs to hit 1 in 3 pitches (33.3%) to be a superstar!</p>

    <p>This may not look it, but this is actually a plankton</p>
    <p>Well... technically. Jellyfish are simple creatures, and are considered to be zooplankton for their
    soft, transparent bodies that are too weak to swim against a current</p>
    <p>The moon jelly in particular has hundreds of fine tentacles and a weak sting opposed to the longer, lesser
    tentacles of other jellyfish.</p>
      <p>This was the first jellyfish species I personally documented in 1997, I mistakenly documented others as
      moon jellies but luckily a colleague corrected me</p>

    <p>Porgies, also known as sea breams, scups, ironsides, and maidens are a broad category of. Referring to any
      of 100 species of shallow-water fish in the family of Sparidae. I have documented a very large variety of them throughout
      New England and Florida and published a science article
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotaro_Kujo">which can be read here</a>,</p>
    <p>They're an easy catch for fishermen, as they are slow, also granting them the names bycatch and "Trash Fish"</p>

    <h2>Common Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>

      <figcaption>https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/animal-care/learn-about-marine-mammals/cetaceans/common-bottlenose-dolphin</figcaption>
    <p>Bottlenose Dolphins are common in tropical and temperate oceans, can swim up to 30 kilometers and hour and dive as
    deep as 250 meters into the water. I love dolphins, they are very intelligent, but they can also be very evil
      and many of the things I have seen on the job are not appropriate for this blog. But many of their good qualities
    can be seen in my Dolphin sub blog.</p>
      <p>The formation of their beaks make it seem as though they are always smiling, but this is just a case of
        anthropomorphism, where we assign human emotions to animals. Similarly to that video I
    see of someone "Tickling" a sting ray while it's gasping for life.</p>
    <p>It may look like it's smiling, but imagine being
    deep underwater and being tickled, forcing what little air you have out of your lungs and flooding it with sea water.
      In my delinquent days, I would get into fights and many times I angered the wrong man, I can liken the experience
      of dealing with the consequences of my actions to these fish. Like I am seconds away from drowning, only to be dragged
      deeper and deeper into the ocean.
    This is why empathy is a very important thing for someone to have. As much as I like them, in my experience, Dolphins
      lack empathy.</p>

    <p>Funny story: My surname is actually pronounced Kujo (空条), but when I moved to the United States for work,
      the immigration officer misunderstood me and spelt it out as "Cujoh", now my daughter's legal
      surname is Cujoh. It irks me, but I hear this happens to many people, so it's nice to know I am not alone.</p>
    <p>My mother was an englishwoman, so she taught me some english, I also learned it in Junior High when I still
      lived in my birth nation of Japan. I'm fluent in it now, but back then it was very exhausting to speak!
      I simply could not challenge him.</p>

    <h2>Red Lionfish</h2>

      <figcaption>https://lucnix.be/picture.php?/47608/categories/created-monthly-list-2010-5-23</figcaption>
    <p>The Lionfish is native to the Indo-Pacific region of the Red Sea. But I have seen many in the
    Western Atlantic Basin, particularly when I traveled to Jamaica to document marine populations there in 2003</p>
    <p>They're an invasive species in the western hemisphere, they're so numerous at this point that it is pointless
    to get rid of them. They are here to stay, and while we have a responsibility to keep them in check,
      natural selection will have the final say in the coming centuries, hopefully it creates a balance and does not
    result in the extinction of populations unable to defend themselves from it.</p>
    <p>Some people in Jamaica have taken to eating lionfish, as it has no predators there. I joined in if it was ever
      served where I was at, I personally dislike the taste, but I'm happy to know I contributed to nature's attempt at
      finding balance for Atlantic Basin in these strange times, however miniscule.</p>

    <h2>Galapagos Penguin</h2>

      <figcaption>https://storyteller.travel/galapagos-penguin/</figcaption>
    <p>The Galapagos Penguin live northmost of all other penguin species, generally, the western part of the
    Galapagos islands. They are also the smallest of them all.. They can be distinguished by a narrow C-shaped band of
      white feathers on both sides of their heads from their eyes to their chin, and a single band of black feathers
      across their breast</p>
    <p>They hunt in groups, mainly eating smaller fish like pilchards and mullets, and sometimes crustaceans.</p>
    <p>They're threatened by invasive predators in the form of land mammals such as dogs, cats, and rats, as well as
      el nino events which greatly reduce their access to food. They are currently endagered, with only 1,200 individuals
    alive at the moment.</p>

    <h2>Egypt - 1988</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rmkPvoS.png" class="responsive">
      <figcaption>Circa 1988</figcaption>
    <p>In October 1988, my mother fell gravely ill. In order to arrange her treatment, my grandfather (Bottom right)
    flew me and a few others we met shortly before departure from Tokyo to Cairo, Egypt, where doctors could treat her illness.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, our plane crashed near Hong Kong, we survived, forcing us to walk and drive there over the course of two months.
      We traveled through Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Pakistan, The United Arab Emirates, and the Red Sea before finally
      reaching Egypt.</p>
    <p>I (Top left) was a juvenile delinquent back then, and while I did and still do love my mother, during the trip I gave
    them all a very hard time. Looking back, I did enjoy the trip. Unfortunately, two of us passed away on our way
    back. I still miss them... </p>
